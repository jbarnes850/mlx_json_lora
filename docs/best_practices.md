# Best Practices

## Model Selection

### Hardware Considerations
- **8GB RAM**: Use Phi-3-mini for fastest training
- **12GB RAM**: Gemma-2B for balanced performance
- **16GB RAM**: Qwen2.5-4B for best quality

### Memory Optimization
1. Enable gradient checkpointing
2. Use memory efficient attention
3. Adjust batch size based on available RAM
4. Close memory-intensive applications

## Training Data

### Data Preparation
1. Clean and validate your dataset
2. Use consistent formatting
3. Balance conversation lengths
4. Include diverse examples

### Format Guidelines
```json
{
    "conversations": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Clear, specific query"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Detailed, relevant response"}
    ]
}
```

## Training Process

### Before Training
1. Verify system requirements
2. Close unnecessary applications
3. Check available disk space
4. Validate dataset format

### During Training
1. Monitor system resources
2. Check training logs
3. Save checkpoints regularly
4. Watch for error messages

### After Training
1. Validate model outputs
2. Export model weights
3. Archive training logs
4. Document configuration

## Production Deployment

### Model Export
1. Use the export script
2. Verify exported files
3. Test loaded weights
4. Document deployment steps

### Performance Optimization
1. Use appropriate batch sizes
2. Enable hardware optimizations
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Profile inference speed

## Common Pitfalls

### Memory Issues
- Starting with too large a model
- Insufficient cleanup between runs
- Memory leaks in long sessions
- Large batch sizes

### Training Issues
- Poor data quality
- Inconsistent formatting
- Insufficient examples
- Wrong configuration

### Deployment Issues
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect paths
- Permission problems
- Version mismatches

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with Phi-3-mini
   - Use small datasets first
   - Validate entire pipeline
   - Scale up gradually

2. **Monitor Everything**
   - Watch system resources
   - Check training metrics
   - Validate outputs
   - Keep logs

3. **Maintain Quality**
   - Clean training data
   - Consistent formatting
   - Regular validation
   - Document changes

4. **Plan for Production**
   - Version control
   - Documentation
   - Testing
   - Monitoring
